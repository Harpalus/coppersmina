    image dimensions

## Performance and security

AKA: Why is this script running on every page?

This script will run on every page because the domain name is not usefull to
identify an installed Coppermine gallery in the website.

Before doing the heavy work the script will try to detect if the page is a
Coppermine gallery. The script scans the page for anchors containing the string
"coppermine".

## "Always run" feature

The "always run" feature allows the execution of the heavy work even if the
script failed to detect the site as Coppermine gallery. This is usefull when
the webmaster changed the web pages resulting in a failed detection.

To enable the "always run" feature search for a menu command into the
GreaseMonkey/Tampermonkey/etc men√π.

I usually forget options like "always run" enabled, so i added an automatic
disabling after 24 hours.

Running the script in a non-coppermine site may cause problems and make some
sites misbehave.

The "always run" feature needs to read into the configuration if it's enabled or
not, this means a read from disk on every page load. If you are a performance
freak you can disable this option.
